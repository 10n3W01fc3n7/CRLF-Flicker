CRLF Injection Scanner
This is a Python script that automates the process of detecting CRLF injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

Features:

Sends GET requests with various CRLF payloads to a target URL.
Checks the response body for the presence of a predefined string ("InjectedString") to indicate successful injection.
Tests a wide range of common CRLF injection payloads, including URL encoding variations and different line ending combinations

Usage:Install dependencies: Ensure you have subprocess module installed (pip install subprocess).

Run the script:Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Run python crlf_scanner.py.

Provide inputs:Enter the target URL when prompted.

Enter the cookies associated with the target URL (optional). 

Cookie-format:session=dJkrd8pkPVBBcNu2AX2ODMEdNY38Xw8f;
Cookies are often used to maintain session state or store user preferences. If the target application requires cookies for authentication or specific functionality, you need to provide them for the script to send valid requests.
Output:
The script will iterate through the payload list and report whether the injection was successful for each payload.
Disclaimer:

This script is intended for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used against systems without explicit permission.

Limitations:

This script focuses on detecting CRLF injection vulnerabilities through GET requests. It may not be effective for detecting vulnerabilities in other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, etc.) or complex injection scenarios.
The success of CRLF injection often depends on the server-side configuration and the specific application logic. This script may not identify all potential injection points.
The script relies on the presence of a specific string ("InjectedString") in the response to confirm successful injection. This may not always be a reliable indicator, especially if the server sanitizes the response body.
